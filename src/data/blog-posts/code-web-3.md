## Introduction

Hey friends 👋 - it's been a while since my last post! Today, I’m continuing my little series: **“A Pharmacist's Journey to Building a Website with LLMs”**. In the first two parts, I experimented with basic AI coding assistants like Gemini - mostly by copy-pasting code manually. I also explored more advanced tools like Cursor and Trove IDE.

But let’s be honest - even those tools can feel overwhelming if you’re coming from a non-coding background.

That’s why in this post, I want to share a **simple no-code approach** that helped me build a personal blog in just 30 minutes. Yes, **no code, no stress**, and still using AI. Let’s go! 🚀

## So, How Does It Work?

Let me introduce you to **[Lovable](https://lovable.dev/)** – a text-to-app platform that helps you build full-fledged web apps just by chatting with an AI. No programming knowledge required.

> ✨ Imagine talking to ChatGPT, but instead of getting a response, you get a live website!

Sounds like magic? Almost. But there are a few things you should know to make it work *well* - and avoid wasting those precious free credits (Lovable gives you 5 free generations/day).

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Start with a Clear Idea

Before you jump in and start chatting with the AI, take 5 minutes to plan your blog.

Think about:

- What pages do you want? (Home, About Me, Blog, Contact…)
- What content do you want to show?
- What style or vibe fits your personality?

👉 If you’re out of ideas, check out [SpaceSquare](https://spacesquare.io/) or [Lovable Examples](https://lovable.dev/)- it offers beautiful templates that you can use for inspiration.

### 2. Use ChatGPT to Write a Prompt

Now open ChatGPT (or any AI assistant you like) and ask it:

> _"Can you help me write a detailed prompt for AI coding assistant to create a personal blog website?"_

You’ll get something like:

![Example Image](/assets/how-to-web-3/chatgpt-prompt.png)

Copy that prompt and paste it into Lovable. Boom - you’ll have a basic website skeleton ready in seconds.

---

### 3. First Draft of the Website

Once you’ve crafted your prompt with the help of ChatGPT, paste it into the **Lovable chat**, and let the magic happen.

Seriously — just sit back, grab a cup of tea ☕, and let the AI do its thing.

You’ll get a working website draft in a few moments. It might not be *perfect*, but that’s totally fine. The next step is just a matter of chatting with the AI again:

- Want to change a section layout? Tell it.
- Want to add a photo? Just ask.
- Something looks off? Be specific.

> 🧠 **Pro tip**: *Context is everything.* The more clearly you explain what you want, the better the results you'll get.

Here’s a quick demo video to show how it works:

<div class="video-container">
    <video controls autoplay muted loop>
        <source src="/assets/how-to-web-3/lovable-use.mov" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
    <p class="video-caption">Watch how I chat with AI to build a full website – no code, just conversation 💬</p>
</div>

### 4. The Trick: Don’t Stop There

Lovable will generate a site, but the content will be… very generic. You'll need to **edit it** to make it your own.

Instead of burning more free generations on minor tweaks, here’s the smarter move:

#### 👉 Connect to GitHub

- Click the **GitHub** button (top-right corner).
- Connect your GitHub account (if you don’t have one, it's easy and free to create).
- Lovable will push your project code to a private GitHub repo.

> 🧠 Bonus: GitHub isn’t just for coders - it’s a place to manage your project like a pro. Welcome to your first step into the world of devs 😉

#### Edit Content in VS Code (Online!)

Once the repo is set up, Lovable gives you a button: **“Edit in VSCode”**. Click it, and voilà - a cloud editor opens with all your website files.

Want to change some text? Just:

- Click the **magnifying glass** icon on the left
- Search for the text you want to edit
- Replace it with your own content
- A **branch** icon will blink up - click on it
- Add a message (e.g. "update") to the box and hit **Commit & Push**

You don’t need to understand the code. Just look for the content, and update what you need.

<div class="video-container">
    <video controls autoplay muted loop>
        <source src="/assets/how-to-web-3/lovable-use.mov" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
    <p class="video-caption">Easy to edit small content</p>
</div>

### 5. Publish Your Site

You’ve got two options to go live:

- **GitHub Pages** (check my [first blog](#) for a guide)
- **Lovable's built-in Publish** button - super simple, gives you a link right away

Choose whatever works best for you!

## Quick Tips

- ✅ Change the **favicon** by replacing the file in `/public/favicon.ico` with your own (you can convert any image to `.ico` format online)
- ✅ Make small tweaks in VSCode rather than re-generating the whole app
- ✅ Back up your edits with GitHub - just in case something breaks

---

## Conclusion

That’s it! 🎉 You’ve just created your own blog using AI - without writing a single line of code. Whether you're a complete beginner or someone exploring faster workflows, this approach is a fun, flexible, and beginner-friendly way to create your online presence.

Let me know if you try it out, or if you run into any trouble - happy to help!

Good luck, and keep building 💪
