# How I Built a Personal Blog in 30 Minutes Using AI (No Code Needed)

## Introduction

Hey friends 👋 — it's been a while since my last post! Today, I’m continuing my little series: **“A Pharmacist's Journey to Building a Website with LLMs”**. In the first two parts, I experimented with basic AI coding assistants like Gemini — mostly by copy-pasting code manually. I also explored more advanced tools like Cursor and Trove IDE.

But let’s be honest — even those tools can feel overwhelming if you’re coming from a non-coding background.

That’s why in this post, I want to share a **simple no-code approach** that helped me build a personal blog in just 30 minutes. Yes, **no code, no stress**, and still using AI. Let’s go! 🚀

## So, How Does It Work?

Let me introduce you to **[Lovable](https://lovable.app)** – a text-to-app platform that helps you build full-fledged web apps just by chatting with an AI. No programming knowledge required.

> ✨ Imagine talking to ChatGPT, but instead of getting a response, you get a live website!

Sounds like magic? Almost. But there are a few things you should know to make it work *well* — and avoid wasting those precious free credits (Lovable gives you 5 free generations/day).

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Start with a Clear Idea

Before you jump in and start chatting with the AI, take 5 minutes to plan your blog.

Think about:

- What pages do you want? (Home, About Me, Blog, Contact…)
- What content do you want to show?
- What style or vibe fits your personality?

👉 If you’re out of ideas, check out [SpaceSquare](https://spacesquare.io/) — it offers beautiful templates that you can use for inspiration.

### 2. Use ChatGPT to Write a Prompt

Now open ChatGPT (or any AI assistant you like) and ask it:

> _"Can you help me write a detailed prompt for Lovable to create a personal blog website?"_

You’ll get something like:

Build me a personal blog website with the following pages:
	•	Home: includes an introduction and featured posts
	•	About Me: short bio with photo and links
	•	Blog: simple blog layout with post previews
	•	Contact: contact form and social links

Design it in a minimal, clean style with soft colors and mobile-friendly layout.

Copy that prompt and paste it into Lovable. Boom — you’ll have a basic website skeleton ready in seconds.

### 3. The Trick: Don’t Stop There

Lovable will generate a site, but the content will be… very generic. You'll need to **edit it** to make it your own.

Instead of burning more free generations on minor tweaks, here’s the smarter move:

#### 👉 Connect to GitHub

- Click the **GitHub** button (top-right corner).
- Connect your GitHub account (if you don’t have one, it's easy and free to create).
- Lovable will push your project code to a private GitHub repo.

> 🧠 Bonus: GitHub isn’t just for coders — it’s a place to manage your project like a pro. Welcome to your first step into the world of devs 😉

---

### 4. Edit Content in VS Code (Online!)

Once the repo is set up, Lovable gives you a button: **“Edit in VSCode”**. Click it, and voilà — a cloud editor opens with all your website files.

Want to change some text? Just:

- Click the **magnifying glass** icon on the left
- Search for the text you want to edit
- Replace it with your own content
- Hit **Save**, and you're done!

You don’t need to understand the code. Just look for the content, and update what you need.

---

### 5. Publish Your Site

You’ve got two options to go live:

- **GitHub Pages** (check my [first blog](#) for a guide)
- **Lovable's built-in Publish** button — super simple, gives you a link right away

Choose whatever works best for you!

---

## Quick Tips

- ✅ Change the **favicon** by replacing the file in `/public/favicon.ico` with your own (you can convert any image to `.ico` format online)
- ✅ Make small tweaks in VSCode rather than re-generating the whole app
- ✅ Back up your edits with GitHub — just in case something breaks

---

## Conclusion

That’s it! 🎉 You’ve just created your own blog using AI — without writing a single line of code. Whether you're a complete beginner or someone exploring faster workflows, this approach is a fun, flexible, and beginner-friendly way to create your online presence.

Let me know if you try it out, or if you run into any trouble — happy to help!

Good luck, and keep building 💪
