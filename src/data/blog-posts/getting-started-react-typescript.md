# Getting Started with React and TypeScript

TypeScript has become an essential tool for modern React development, providing type safety and improved developer experience. In this post, we'll explore how to set up a new React project with TypeScript and cover some best practices.

## Why TypeScript with React?

TypeScript offers several advantages when working with React:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **Better IntelliSense**: Enhanced autocomplete and refactoring support
- **Self-documenting Code**: Types serve as inline documentation
- **Easier Refactoring**: Safe and confident code changes

## Setting Up the Project

To create a new React project with TypeScript, you can use Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will create a new React project with TypeScript configuration already set up.

## Basic Component Types

Here's how to type a simple React component:

```typescript
interface Props {
  title: string;
  count?: number;
  onIncrement: () => void;
}

const Counter: React.FC<Props> = ({ title, count = 0, onIncrement }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={onIncrement}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Conclusion

TypeScript and React make a powerful combination for building maintainable and scalable applications. Start small, gradually add types, and enjoy the improved development experience!
